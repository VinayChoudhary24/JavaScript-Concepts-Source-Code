//it works like MAP function.
//we can use anonnymous and arrow functions

//PURPOSE OF THIS  FUNCTION:-
 
  /*
  //1.CREATE AN ARRAY
  let arr = [2, 22, 34, 455, 876,87]; //NOW IF WE WANT TO FILTER THIS ARRAY, WE USE FILTER FUNCTION like, filter numbers which are greater than 40.  
 
  //2.call the filter function
  //let arr1 = arr.filter(function(val){
    //return val > 40;
  //}); //with anonymous function
  
  
  let arr1 = arr.filter(val =>
    val > 40);
  console.log(arr1); //[455, 876, 87] with arrow function
  */

  /*
  //2.CREATE AN ARRAY OF OBJECTS:-
  let team = [{
    name:"VC",
    position:"Software Engineer"
